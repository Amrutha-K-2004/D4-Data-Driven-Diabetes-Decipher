# D4 — Data-Driven Diabetes Decipher

An experimental C++ / Qt project for exploring and visualizing diabetes data (includes a simple GUI and data processing tools). This repository contains code, UI forms and example datasets used during development.

## Highlights

- Data: `diabetes.csv` (included) — used for analysis and UI demos.
- GUI: Qt-based interface (see `D4/` and `ui_authenticationdialog.h`).
- Build targets: example Makefiles and Qt project files (`D4.pro`).
- Useful for learning C++ data processing, Qt GUI wiring, and lightweight data exploration.

## Quick look

Top-level files and folders you'll likely care about:

- `D4/` — primary Qt project files and UI sources.
- `main.cpp`, `interface.cpp`, `httpwindow.cpp` — core program entry and UI logic.
- `diabetes.csv` — sample dataset used by the project.
- `final*.cpp`, `alternate*.cpp`, `try1.cpp` — experimental/alternate implementations.

## Requirements

- Qt (5.x or 6.x) and Qt Creator (recommended) OR qmake + make environment.
- A C++ compiler (MSVC or MinGW on Windows).
- CMake is not required; qmake/Makefiles are included.

## Build & Run

Recommended: open the `D4/D4.pro` file in Qt Creator and build from there. Qt Creator will handle kit selection and compile settings for you.

If you prefer the command line (PowerShell example for Windows with qmake + MinGW):

```powershell
# From project root
cd .\\D4
# generate Makefile (adjust for qmake location if needed)
qmake D4.pro
mingw32-make
# After build, run the produced executable (path depends on kit and build config)
.\\release\\D4.exe
```

If you're using MSVC (Visual Studio) or another toolchain, open the project in Qt Creator or load the `D4.pro` into your environment and follow your toolchain's build steps.

Notes:
- There are convenience Makefiles under `build-D4-Windows-Debug/`. Those were auto-generated by Qt Creator for a specific kit — you can use them if your environment matches the one used to create them.

## What this repo contains (short)

- GUI components: `D4/` folder (UI file `authenticationdialog.ui`, generated `ui_authenticationdialog.h`).
- App logic: `main.cpp`, `httpwindow.cpp` and related headers.
- Data: `diabetes.csv` used by demonstration programs.
- Multiple experimental versions: `alternate*`, `final*`, `finalfinal*` — these show iterative experiments.

## Dataset

The repository contains a sample dataset `diabetes.csv`. Use this file for local testing and experiments. If you plan to use real patient data, make sure to follow privacy and legal requirements (de-identify data and obtain permissions where required).

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! A few suggestions:

1. Open issues describing bugs or feature requests.
2. Send PRs for small, focused improvements (unit tests, docs, UI polish).
3. For larger refactors, open an issue first to discuss the approach.

When submitting code changes:

- Keep commits focused and add a descriptive message.
- Ensure the project still builds on at least one environment (Qt Creator + MinGW or MSVC).

## Next steps & ideas

- Add a small test harness or unit tests for data parsing.
- Add a sample screenshot and short demo video in the README.
- Add CI to build the project automatically on push.

## License

This repository does not include an explicit license file. If you want others to use or contribute, add a `LICENSE` (for example, MIT or Apache-2.0) and update this section.
