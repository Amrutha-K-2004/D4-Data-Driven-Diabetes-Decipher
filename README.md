# D4 — Data-Driven Diabetes Decipher 🔬📊

An experimental C++ / Qt project for exploring and visualizing diabetes data . This repository contains code, UI forms and example datasets used during development.

## Highlights ✨

- 📁 Data: `diabetes.csv` — included and used for analysis and UI demos.
- 🖥️ GUI: Qt-based interface 
- 🎯 Good for learning Machine Learning , C++ data processing, Qt GUI wiring, and lightweight data exploration.


## Requirements ⚙️

- 🧩 Qt (5.x or 6.x) and Qt Creator (recommended) OR qmake + make environment.
- 🛠️ A C++ compiler (MSVC or MinGW on Windows).
- ⚠️ CMake is not required; qmake/Makefiles are included.



## Dataset 📊

The repository contains a sample dataset `diabetes.csv`. Use this file for local testing and experiments. If you plan to use real patient data, make sure to follow privacy and legal requirements (de-identify data and obtain permissions where required). ⚠️

## Contributing 🤝

Contributions are welcome! A few suggestions:

1. 🐛 Open issues describing bugs or feature requests.
2. ✨ Send PRs for small, focused improvements (unit tests, docs, UI polish).
3. 🔧 For larger refactors, open an issue first to discuss the approach.

When submitting code changes 📝:

- ✅ Keep commits focused and add a descriptive message.
- 🔁 Ensure the project still builds on at least one environment (Qt Creator + MinGW or MSVC).
